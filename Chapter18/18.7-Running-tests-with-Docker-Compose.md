# Running tests with Docker Compose
As mentioned in Chapter 17, Implementing Kubernetes Features as an Alternative (refer to the Verifying that the microservices work without Kubernetes section), it is important to ensure that the source code of the microservices doesn't become dependent on a platform such as Kubernetes or Istio from a functional perspective.

To verify that the microservices work as expected without the presence of Kubernetes and Istio, run the tests as described in Chapter 17, Implementing Kubernetes Features as an Alternative (refer to the Testing with Docker Compose section). Since the default values of the test script, test-em-all.bash, are changed, as described previously in the Running commands to create the service mesh section, the following parameters must be set when using Docker Compose: HOST=localhost PORT=8443 HEALTH_URL=https://localhost:8443. For example, to run the tests using the default Docker Compose file, docker-compose.yml, run the following command:
```
HOST=localhost PORT=8443 HEALTH_URL=https://localhost:8443 ./test-em-all.bash start stop
```

The tests should, as before, begin by starting all containers; it should then run the tests, and finally stop all containers. For details of the expected output, see Chapter 17, Implementing Kubernetes Features as an Alternative (refer to the Verifying that the microservices work without Kubernetes section).

After successfully executing the tests using Docker Compose, we have verified that the microservices are dependent neither on Kubernetes nor Istio from a functional perspective. These tests conclude the chapter on using Istio as a service mesh.
