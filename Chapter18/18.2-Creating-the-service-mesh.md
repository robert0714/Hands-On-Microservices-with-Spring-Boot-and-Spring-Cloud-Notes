### Update the deployment scripts to inject Istio proxies

The scripts used to deploy microservices in Kubernetes, ***deploy-dev-env.bash*** and ***deploy-prod-env.bash***, both in the ***kubernetes/scripts*** folder, have been updated to inject Istio proxies into the five microservices, that is, the auth-server, product-composite, product, recommendation, and review services.

- The deploy-prod-env.bash script will be used in the ***Performing zero downtime deploys*** section.

The istioctl kube-inject command previously described in the Injecting Istio proxies in existing microservices section has been added to both deployment scripts as follows:
```
   kubectl get deployment auth-server product product-composite recommendation review -o yaml | istioctl kube-inject -f - | kubectl apply -f -
```

Since the ***kubectl apply*** command will start a rolling upgrade, the following command has been added to wait for the upgrade to be completed:
```
   waitForPods 5 'version=<version>'
```

During the rolling upgrade, we will have two pods running for each microservice: an old one without an Istio proxy and a new one with the Istio proxy injected. The ***waitForPods*** function will wait until the old pods are terminated; that is, the rolling upgrade is complete, and only the five new pods are running. To identify what pods to wait for, a label named version is used. In a development environment, all microservice pods are labeled with ***version=latest***.

For example, the deployment file for the product
microservice, ***kubernetes/services/base/deployments/product-deployment.yml***, has the following definition of the version label:

```
   metadata:
     labels:
       version: latest
```

- In the ***Performing zero downtime deployments*** section, where we will upgrade microservices from version ***v1*** to ***v2***, the version label will be set to ***v1*** and ***v2*** .


Finally, the following command has been added to the scripts to make them wait until the deployments and their pods are ready:
```
   kubectl wait --timeout=120s --for=condition=Ready pod --all
```

After reviewing the updates in the deployment scripts, let's see how the file structure of the Kubernetes definition files has been affected as a result of the introduction of Istio.

## Running commands to create the service mesh

Create the service mesh by running the following commands:
1. Build Docker images from source with the following commands:
```
          cd $BOOK_HOME/Chapter18
          eval $(minikube docker-env)
          ./gradlew build && docker-compose build
```
2. Recreate the hands-on namespace, and set it as the default namespace:
```
   kubectl delete namespace hands-on
   kubectl create namespace hands-on
   kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=hands-on
   # if you executed the command istioctl kube-inject -f - ,you donnot need the below command
   # kubectl label namespace hands-on istio-injection=enabled
```
3. Execute the deployment by running the ***deploy-dev-env.bash*** script with the following command:
```
   ./kubernetes/scripts/deploy-dev-env.bash
```

4. Once the deployment is complete, verify that we have two containers in each of the microservice pods:
```
   kubectl get pods
```  
  Using a Service Mesh to Improve Observability and Management Chapter 18
  Note that the pods that run our microservices report two containers per pod; that is, they have the Istio proxy injected as a sidecar!
  
5. Run the usual tests with the following command:
```
   ./test-em-all.bash
```
-  The default values for script test-em-all.bash have been updated from previous chapters to accommodate Kubernetes running in Minikube.  
-  Expect the output to be similar to what we have seen in previous chapters:
```bash
   % ./test-em-all.bash

          End, all tests OK: 2021年 4月16日 週五 21時15分34秒 CST
```

6. You can try out the APIs manually by running the following commands:
```bash
  ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl -k https://writer:secret@minikube.me/oauth/token -d grant_type=password -d username=magnus -d password=password -s | jq            .access_token -r)
  
  curl -ks https://minikube.me/product-composite/2 -H "Authorization:Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" | jq .productId
```
Expect the requested product ID, 2, in the response.

With the service mesh up and running, let's see how we can observe what's going on in the service mesh using Kiali!
