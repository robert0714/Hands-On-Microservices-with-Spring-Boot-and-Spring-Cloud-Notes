The deployment uses the same type of commands as we used in Chapter 16, Deploying Our Microservices to Kubernetes; refer to the Deploying to Kubernetes for development and test
section.

The major differences are that this deployment will:

- Create one config map for each microservice instead of one config map for
the configuration server
- Create secrets for credentials to the resource managers and a secret for the TLS
certificate used by the ingress instead of creating secrets for the credentials to
the configuration server
- Create one ingress instead of using Spring Cloud Gateway

To simplify the deployment, deploy scripts for the development and
production environments have been added to the source code. Let's go through the deploy
script for the development environment that we will use in this section.

## Walking through the deploy script
The ***kubernetes/scripts/deploy-dev-env.bash*** script, contains the necessary
commands for performing the deployment. The script will perform the following steps:

  1. It will create config maps, one per microservice. For example, for the product
  microservice, we have the following:
  ```bash
  kubectl create configmap config-repo-product  --from-file=config-repo/application.yml --from-file=config-repo/product.yml --save-config
  ```
  2. Then, it will create the required secrets. For example, credentials for accessing
  RabbitMQ are created with the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic rabbitmq-credentials \
      --from-literal=SPRING_RABBITMQ_USERNAME=rabbit-user-dev \
      --from-literal=SPRING_RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=rabbit-pwd-dev \
      --save-config
  ```
  3. Secrets are also created for the resource managers; their names are suffixed
  with ***server-credentials***. They are used in the Kubernetes definitions files in
  the ***kubernetes/services/overlays/dev*** folder. For example, credentials
  used by RabbitMQ are created with the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl create secret generic rabbitmq-server-credentials \
      --from-literal=RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_USER=rabbit-user-dev \
      --from-literal=RABBITMQ_DEFAULT_PASS=rabbit-pwd-dev \
      --save-config
  ```
  4. The secret that contains the TLS certificate for the ingress, ***tls-certificate***, is
  based on the already existing self-signed certificate in
  the ***kubernetes/cert*** folder. It is created with the following command:
  ```bash
  kubectl create secret tls tls-certificate --key
  kubernetes/cert/tls.key --cert kubernetes/cert/tls.crt
  ```
  - The self-signed certificate has been created with the following command:
    ```
    openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -days 365 -newkey   rsa:2048 -keyout kubernetes/cert/tls.key -out   kubernetes/cert/tls.crt -subj   "/CN=minikube.me/O=minikube.me"
    ```
  5. Deploy the microservices for the development environment, based on
  the ***dev*** overlay, using the ***-k*** switch to activate Kustomize:
  ```
  kubectl apply -k kubernetes/services/overlays/dev
  ```
  6. Wait for the deployment and its pods to be up and running:
  ```
  kubectl wait --timeout=600s --for=condition=ready pod --all
  ```

After this walkthrough, we are ready to run the commands required for deploying and testing!
